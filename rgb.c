/*
For this project, imagine a bunch of little lights (maybe 20 or 40 of them),
on a table, each about the size of a chess piece.
Each is independent of the other.
You arrange them around on the table any way you want.
Each one continually slowly changes colors on its own.
When you wave your hand over them, it creates waves of colors that follow your hand.
*/


/*
I added an IR emitter and IR detector to the Trippy RGB Light to create this project.
Then converted the firmware to work with an ATtiny25 instead of an ATtiny2313 (because
it is smaller and cheaper).
The Trippy RGB Light uses 3 LEDs, one Red, one Green, one Blue, each fading at different
rates so that when the light from the three LEDs add together, you get a lot of changing
colors (you can get any color a computer monitor can get using different brightnesses of
Red, Green, and Blue light -- this is the way computer monitors create color).  Trippy!

For this project instead of three LEDs, I used one RGB LED (which is one package
containing a Red, a Green, and a Blue LED, all in one package).

The project uses one IR emitter and one IR detector.

The IR detector I chose is very sensitive to IR light that is pulsing at about 38KHz,
and it is very insensitive to IR light that is not pulsing near 38KHz.

The IR emitter is pointed up, and frequently outputs IR light pusling at about 38KHz.
The IR detector is also pointed up, and has one output,
which is Low when it sees 38KHz IR light reflecting from above
(such as when you wave your hand over it, thus reflecting the IR light from the IR emitter),
and the output is High when it does not see 38KHz IR light.

Since the output of the IR detector is connected to an input pin, when the output from the
IR detector goes Low, the firmware can detect this, and restart the firmware from the
beginning, and the net effect is that you see a wave of colors move under you hand
(assuming that there are a lot of these devices near each other on a table).
*/


/*
This project provides a good example of how to use Pulse Width Modulation (PWM)
to fade a voltage up or down (in this case, the changing voltage is used to
control the brightness of Red, Green, and Blue LEDs).

We will use one of the two hardware timers that are embedded inside of the ATtiny25,
set up to control PWM for the Red LED and the Blue LED.  Since there are only two
timer compare regsiters on the one hardware timer, we will create PWM for the Green LED
by manually pulsing it in a firmware loop.
(The other hardware timer will be used to pulse an IR emitter at 38KHz.)

With PWM, we vary the amount of time an LED is on versus how long it is off.
We repeatedly turn an LED on and off very quickly (so quickly you can't see it blink).
If the LED is on 50% of the time (and off for 50% of the time),
  it will be half as bright as if it were on all of the time.
If the LED is on 25% of the time (and off for 75% of the time),
  it will be one quarter as bright as if it were on all of the time.
Each time we turn the LED on and off, the amount of time it is on,
  added to the amount of time it is off, always equals the same length of time
  (this length of time is known as the "PWM period").
It doesn't really matter what the PWM period is,
  as long as it is short enough that we can't perceive the the LED flicker.
  We can perceive flickering if an LED blinks slower than about 1/30 of a second,
  or about 0.033 seconds (or 30Hz).
  In this firmware, I keep the PWM period to less than 0.01 seconds (faster than 100Hz)
    so there is no perceieved flicker (though it is interesting to wave the unit back
    and forth while it is running, and you can actually see the PWM pusle widths widen
    and shrink over time).
*/


/*
This project also provides a simple example of how to use interrupts.

An interrupt is a function like any other, except rather than being called from
somewhere in the firmware, it is called by a hardware event.  In the case of this
firmware, the interrupt function is called whenever the IR detector sees IR light.

An interrupt function is conventionally called "Interrupt Service Routine", or "ISR".

The IR detector is connected to PB3 (set up as an input pin).  PB3 can be set up
so that whenever it sees a logic change from Low to High or from High to Low, it
calls an ISR named PCINT0.  Below you will see the following code:
     ISR(PCINT0_vect) {
       Start_Over = 1;
     }
This is the ISR.  All it does is set a variable that the main routine will see, and
when the main routine sees it, it jumps to the beginning to start the firmware over.

To enable the PCINT0 interrupt, we need to do a few things.  First of all, we need
to include the header for interrupt handling.  You will see the following include
statement, below, to handle that:
     include <avr/interrupt.h>
Next we need to set up two control registers in the ATtiny25 to tell it to generate
interrupts for PB3 logic change (the AVR datasheet calls this a "Pin Change
Interrupt").  You will see the following two lines in the main function, below:
  GIMSK = 0b00100000;   // PCIE=1 to enable Pin Change Interrupts
  PCMSK = 0b00001000;   // PCINT3 bit = 1 to enable Pin Change Interrupts for PB3

Finally, we need to enable the interrupts for the ATtiny25.  This line accomplishes
that:
  sei();  // enable microcontroller interrupts

When we are finished, before putting the microcontroller to sleep, we disable
interrupts with the following line of code:
  cli();  // disable microcontroller interrupts

/*
A very brief tutorial about binary numbers, bits, bytes, and regsiters:
----------------------------------------------------------------------

You do not need to know any of this to build and use this project.  You don't even
need to know any of this to hack the firmware.  But this may be helpful if you want
to do some more in depth hacking of the firmware.  And besides, the more you learn,
the more cool stuff you will be able to do!  So, check it out...

In decimal numbers (the ones we normally use in our every-day lives), numbers have
"digits".  For example, the number 23 has two digits.  Since decimal numbers are
base-10, the "2" in the number 23 is in the "ten" position, meaning we have two
"tens".  The "3" is in the "one" position, meaning we have three "ones".  Putting
all that together:  we have 2 tens, plus three ones, to come up with 23.

In binary numbers (the ones used by computers), numbers have "bits" instead of "digits".
For example, the number 10111 has 5 bits.  Since binary numbers are base-2, the 1 all of
the way on the left is in the "sixteen" position, meaning we have one "sixteen".  The 0
that is the fourth from the right is the "eight" position, meaning we have no "eights".
The 1 that is the third from the right is in the "four" position, meaning we have one
"four".  The 1 that is the second from the right is in the "two" position, meaning we
have one "two".  The 1 that is right-most is in the "one" position, meaning we have one
"one".  Putting all that together:
we have 1 sixteen, plus 1 four, plus 1 two, plus 1 one, to come up with 23.

Most microcontrollers use 8-bit numbers, and all of the bits must have a value of either
0 or 1.  So, for microcontrollers, the decimal number 23 is represented as 00010111
(the three left-most zeros mean that there are no "thirty-twos", no "sixty-fours", no
"one-hundred-twenty-eights").  The bits in a binary number are labeled from the right
starting with the number 0.  So, the right-most bit is called "bit 0", and the bit to
that is to the left of it is called "bit 1", all of the way to the left-most bit of an
8-bit number which is called "bit 7".

A "Byte" means 8 bits.  A "Word" means 16 bits, or two bytes.  And, while I'm at it, I
may as well let you know that a "Nybble" is 4 bits, and there are two nybbles to a byte.

The ATtiny25 microcontroller is an 8-bit microcontroller.  This means that all quantities
inside of the microcontroller are 8-bit quantities.  The C language can use values that
are larger than 8 bits.  The gcc compiler can use 8-bit values, 16-bit values, and 32-bit
values.  The 8-bit values are "char", the 16-bit values are "int", and the 32-bit
values are "long int".  (Other C compilers may be different.)  We use "unsigned" versions
of these, since we are not using negative values in this firmware.  The C compiler
converts all numbers to combinations of 8-bit numbers, since that is all that the
microcontroller can handle (how it does this is a for another discussion later).

C compilers can interpret numbers as decimal numbers, binary numbers, or hexadecimal
(base-16) numbers.  For the gcc compiler, binary numbers are preceded with "0b",
hexadecimal numbers are preceded with "0x", and decimal numbers are not preceded with
anything.  So, to express the number 23 in binary so that the gcc compiler knows you mean
"twenty-three", rather than "ten-thousand one-hundred and eleven", you write it like
this:  0b00010111
This same number also means that bit 0 is High, bit 1 is High, bit 2 is High, bit 4 is
High, and all other bits are Low (bits 3, 5, 6, and 7).

In hexadecimal, each byte has two nybbles, and each nybble is a power of 16.  For
example, 0x17 means one "sixteen" plus 7 "ones", or the decimal number 23 (which means
that bits 0, 1, 2, and 4 are High, and bits 3, 5, 6, and 7 are Low).

So, for the gcc compiler, all three of these numbers mean exactly the same thing:
   23
   0b00010111
   0x17

Microcontrollers have some special memory locations that are called "registers".
Registers control the hardware in the microcontroller.  For example, the DDRB register
for the ATtiny25 controls which of the pins on the microcontroller are inputs and outputs,
and the TCCR0B register controls some aspects of how the internal hardware Timer 0 will
function.  For the ATtiny25, registers are all 8-bits.

In the datasheet for the AVR microcontrollers, Atmel (who makes them) uses a somewhat
confusing convention for describing bits in an 8-bit register.  For example, TCCR0B is
the Timer/Counter Control Register B for Timer 0 (there is also a Register A, and there
is also a TCCR1 register, but since there is only one register for Timer 1, there is no
A and B).  Within TCCR0B there are 8 bits, defined like this:
   FOC0A   FOC0B   --   --   WGM02   CS02   CS01   CS00
There are three bits that start with "CS0":  CS02, CS01, CS00.  To refer to all three
of these in the same sentence, Atmel will refer to them as "CS02:0", which means CS0
bit 2 through CS0 bit 0.  Pretty messed up, but that's what we need to live with.
(And, by the way, these bits are "Clock Select" bits, which tell the microcontroller
how to select the clock, which is the heart-beat that controls the speed at which the
Timer 0 runs.)
The dashes mean that bit 4 and bit 5 are not used.
I won't define the other bits here.

You will see the above definitions in the firmware and comments, below.  For example,
in the comments in the main program, under the statement where we are setting up the
TCCR0B register for Timer 0, you will see:
     // CS02:00=001 for divide by 1 prescaler (this starts Timer0)
This means that CS0 bit 2 is 0, CS0 bit 1 is 0, and CS0 bit 0 is 1 (or stated another
way, the three CS0 bits are set to 001).

The datasheet describes in great depth all of the registers and functionality of the
ATtiny25 microcontroller.  I downloaded my copy of the datasheet from here:
http://www.atmel.com/dyn/resources/prod_documents/doc2586.pdf
But if that link is dead by the time you read this, just do a search for
     atmel attiny25 datasheet
and you'll come up with the latest version.

/*
This project has one RGB LED.
The light from the LED should be diffused so that the light from
it mixes together (a short section of white drinking straw works well).
The firmware goes through a sequence, mixing various amounts of brightness
of R, G, and B to create various different colors, and blinking and fading
these colors to create a trippy effect.
You can easily change this firmware to create your own sequences of colors!

/*
The hardware for this project is very simple:
    ATtiny25 has 8 pins:
       pin 1  RST - connects to programming port pin 5
       pin 2  PB3 - connects to the output of the IR detector (pin 1 of the detector)
       pin 3  OC1B - Blue lead of RGB LED (cathode -- through a 47 ohm current limiting resistor)
       pin 4  ground (connects to ground of the IR detector)
       pin 5  OC0A -  IR emitter (cathode -- through a 1k ohm current limiting resistor) (also connects to programming port pin 4)
       pin 6  OC1A - Red lead of RGB LED (cathode -- through a 47 ohm current limiting resistor) (also connects to programming port pin 1)
       pin 7  PB2 - Green lead of RGB LED (cathode) (also connects to programming port pin 3)
       pin 8  +3v (connects to common anode lead of RGB LED, and anode of IR emitter, and power pin of IR detector)

    The 6-pin programming header (used only if you want to re-program the ATtiny25)
       also needs to have its pin 2 connected to +3v,
       and its pin 6 connected to ground.

    This firmware requires that the clock frequency of the ATtiny
       is the default that it is shipped with:  8.0MHz

/*
The C compiler creates code that will transfer all constants into RAM when the microcontroller
resets.  Since this firmware has a table (lightTab) that is too large to transfer into RAM
(and since we don't need it in RAM) the C compiler needs to be told to keep it in program
memory space.  This is accomplished by the macro PROGMEM (this is used, below, in the
definition for the lightTab).  Since the C compiler assumes that constants are in RAM, rather
than in program memory, when accessing the lightTab, we need to use the pgm_read_byte() macro,
and we need to use the lightTab as an address, i.e., precede it with "&".  For example, to
access lightTab[3].red, which is a byte, this is how to do it:
     pgm_read_byte( &lightTab[3].red );
And to access lightTab[3].fadeTime, which is a word, this is how to do it:
     pgm_read_word( &lightTab[3].fadeTime );
*/



/*
The following Light Table consists of any number of rgbElements that will fit into the
2k flash ROM of the ATtiny25 microcontroller.
Each rgbElement consists of:
     fadeTime -- how long to take to fade from previous values of RGB
                   to the ones specified in this rgbElement
                   (0 or between 1,000 and 65,535)
     holdTime -- how long to keep the RGB values once they are faded in
                   (0 or between 1,000 and 65,535)
     Red      -- brightness value for Red   (between 0 to 255)
     Green    -- brightness value for Green (between 0 to 255)
     Blue     -- brightness value for Blue  (between 0 to 255)
Both of the time values, fadeTime and holdTime, are expressed as the number of 400
microseconds -- for example, 2 seconds would be entered as 5000.
To signify the last rgbElement in the lightTab, its fadeTime and hold time must both
be 0 (all other values of this last rgbElement are ignored).

NOTE:  I measured the time, and each fadeTime and holdTime is actually
          550 microseconds
       instead of 400 microseconds, as calculated.

The values for fadeTime and holdTime must either be 0, or between 1,000 and 65,535
(i.e., 0, or between 0.4 sec and 26.2 sec).

/*
  The Light Sequences and the notions of fadeTime and holdTime
  are taken from Pete Griffiths, downloaded from:
  http://www.petesworld.demon.co.uk/homebrew/PIC/rgb/index.htm

  I modified it to fit my purposes.

  The sequence takes about 2 minutes.
  More precisely:
       adding all of the fadeTime values together:  121,000
       adding all of the holdTime values together:  134,000
       adding these together = 259,000.
  Since the time values are each 400 microseconds, 255,000 is 102.0 seconds,
    or, 1.70 minutes, which is 1 minute, 42 seconds.

  The Main function repeats the sequence several times.
